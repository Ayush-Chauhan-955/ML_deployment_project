![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This repository showcases an end-to-end machine learning project focused on deploying a predictive model. It covers various stages of the ML pipeline, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using Flask and Docker.

Overview
This project aims to demonstrate a practical approach to deploying machine learning models. It includes the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling and preparing the raw data for model training.

Model Training: Training a machine learning model on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model.

Model Saving: Persisting the trained model for later use.

API Development (Flask): Creating a RESTful API using Flask to serve the model predictions.

Containerization (Docker): Packaging the Flask application and its dependencies into a Docker container for easy deployment.

Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

/src: Contains the main source code for the project.

/data_preprocessing: Scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.

preprocess_data.py: (Likely) Script to perform data preprocessing steps.

/model_training: Scripts for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

train_model.py: (Likely) Script to train the machine learning model.

/api: Contains the Flask application for serving the model.

app.py: The main Flask application.

model.pkl: (Likely) The saved trained machine learning model.

/docker: Contains files related to Docker.

Dockerfile: Instructions for building the Docker image.

requirements.txt: Dependencies for the Flask application within the Docker container.

/notebooks: (Optional) Jupyter notebooks used for exploration, prototyping, or analysis.

(Potential notebooks based on the file names)

README.md: The current file, providing an overview of the project.

requirements.txt: Project dependencies for local development.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)

Docker (if you want to run the containerized application)

Installation
Clone the repository:
\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/Devanshu-Chauhan-955/ML_deployment_project.git
cd ML_deployment_project
\end{verbatim}

Create a virtual environment (recommended):
\begin{verbatim}
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
\end{verbatim}

Install the required Python packages:
\begin{verbatim}
pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{verbatim}

Running the Application Locally
Navigate to the src/api directory:
\begin{verbatim}
cd src/api
\end{verbatim}

Run the Flask application:
\begin{verbatim}
python app.py
\end{verbatim}

The Flask application will typically start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Interact with the API:
You can send POST requests to the API endpoint (likely /predict based on common ML deployment patterns) with the input data in JSON format to get predictions. You can use tools like curl, Postman, or Python's requests library.

Example using curl:
(Note: Adjust the input data based on the model's expected features)
\begin{verbatim}
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"feature1": value1, "feature2": value2, ...}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict
\end{verbatim}

Running with Docker
Build the Docker image:
Navigate to the root of the repository and run the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
docker build -t ml-deployment-app .
\end{verbatim}

Run the Docker container:
\begin{verbatim}
docker run -p 5000:5000 ml-deployment-app
\end{verbatim}

This will run the Docker container and map the host machine's port 5000 to the container's port 5000.

Interact with the API:
You can now interact with the API running inside the Docker container at http://localhost:5000/ (or http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

Project Details
Based on the file structure, here's a more detailed breakdown of each component:

Data Preprocessing (src/data_preprocessing/preprocess_data.py)
This script likely performs tasks such as:

Loading raw data.

Handling missing values.

Encoding categorical features.

Scaling numerical features.

Splitting data into training and testing sets (potentially).

Model Training (src/model_training/train_model.py)
This script probably handles:

Loading preprocessed training data.

Defining and training a machine learning model (e.g., scikit-learn classifier or regressor).

Evaluating the trained model on a test set.

Saving the trained model to a file (likely model.pkl in the src/api directory).

Flask API (src/api/app.py)
This file implements a RESTful API using Flask. Key functionalities include:

Loading the trained machine learning model (model.pkl).

Defining an endpoint (e.g., /predict) that accepts input data in JSON format.

Preprocessing the input data in the same way as the training data.

Making predictions using the loaded model.

Returning the predictions as a JSON response.

Docker Configuration (docker/Dockerfile)
The Dockerfile contains instructions to build a Docker image for the Flask application. This typically involves:

Starting with a base Python image.

Copying the application code and dependencies.

Installing the required Python packages (docker/requirements.txt).

Exposing port 5000.

Defining the command to run the Flask application.

Docker Requirements (docker/requirements.txt)
This file lists the Python packages required to run the Flask application within the Docker container (e.g., flask, scikit-learn, pandas).

Potential Improvements and Future Work
More Detailed Documentation: Adding docstrings to the code and more comprehensive explanations of each step.

Data Source: Specifying the source of the data used for training.

Model Selection: Describing the rationale behind the chosen machine learning model.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Implementing techniques for optimizing model hyperparameters.

Testing: Adding unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the code.

Logging: Implementing logging to track application behavior and errors.

CI/CD Pipeline: Setting up a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for automated builds and deployments.

Scalability: Exploring more scalable deployment options (e.g., cloud platforms, container orchestration).

Monitoring: Implementing model performance monitoring in a deployed environment.
