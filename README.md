# üöÄ Deploy Your ML Model: From Training to Docker

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**This project demonstrates a complete workflow for taking a machine learning model from training to a production-ready, containerized API.** Learn how to preprocess data, train a model, build a Flask API, and deploy it with Docker.

## üî• Quick Start

Ready to see it in action?

1.  **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/Devanshu-Chauhan-955/ML_deployment_project.git && cd ML_deployment_project`
2.  **Virtual Env & Install:** `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows) && `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  **Run Locally:** `cd src/api && python app.py` (API will be at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`)
4.  **Dockerize:** `docker build -t ml-app . && docker run -p 5000:5000 ml-app` (API in Docker at `http://localhost:5000/`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Breakdown

*   **`/src/data_preprocessing/`**: Scripts to clean and prepare your data.
*   **`/src/model_training/`**: Code for training and saving your ML model (`model.pkl`).
*   **`/src/api/`**: The Flask web application (`app.py`) that serves your model.
*   **`/docker/`**: Docker configuration (`Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`) for easy deployment.

## üéØ Key Highlights

*   **End-to-End:** Covers the full ML deployment lifecycle.
*   **Practical:** Focuses on real-world steps and tools.
*   **Flask API:** Exposes your model through a simple and robust web interface.
*   **Dockerized:** Ensures consistent and portable deployment across environments.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Potential Improvements

*   **Deeper Dive:** More detailed explanations and comments in the code.
*   **Data Story:** Clearly define the data source and its characteristics.
*   **Model Insights:** Explain the chosen model and its performance metrics.
*   **Testing Power:** Implement unit and integration tests.
*   **Stay Logged In:** Add logging for better monitoring.
*   **Automate Everything:** Explore CI/CD pipelines for seamless updates.
*   **Scale Up:** Consider cloud deployment and orchestration.
*   **Keep an Eye On It:** Implement model performance monitoring.
